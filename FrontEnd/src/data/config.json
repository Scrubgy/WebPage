I actively contributed innovative ideas aimed at enhancing workplace efficiency. My leadership was instrumental in the implementation of a new Scale-House addition, which significantly accelerated the processing of trailers at the plant. In a notable project, I assisted in developing a server system integrated with RFID scanners. This system was designed to scan trailer IDs, thereby facilitating real-time payment information for farmers per truckload. Additionally, I was responsible for designing the schematics for the server system and the Scale-House addition, showcasing my technical design capabilities."
